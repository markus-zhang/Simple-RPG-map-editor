I think I'd better write this down, otherwise I may have a difficult time reading the codes next time.

1) Trigger
If the designer presses "s" or click the Save Button on the up-right corner of the screen, the Save Procedure is triggered.

2) Preparation
Even before the Save Procedure has been triggered, the editor constantly prepares itself for saving.
Each time a new tile has been painted on the screen, cEditorState will push_back a new cTile into m_Map, which is a vector of <cTile>.  It will also
push a new cTileFile (i.e. the data object describing all the data for a tile) into m_MapData.
*Note:  m_Map is the object storing all the cTile objects. We need m_Map to show all the painted tiles (i.e. the whole map) on screen.
        m_Map has nothing to do with saving the map.
        m_MapData is the real object we are to consulate when the Save Procedure has been invoked.

3) Save Procedure
Now we must look into cFile.h to reveal the Save Procedure.
The function is called SaveMap(). You can see the map format at the beginning of the file. The whole procedure is pretty simple:
Step 1: Open "map.txt" (Considering reading the file name from Defines.h, which in turn reads from Editor.ini)
Step 2: Write line by line

It's a shame that I didn't write any code for potential errors, except the one that map.txt doesn't exist.
