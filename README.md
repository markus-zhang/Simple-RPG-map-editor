# Simple-RPG-map-editor
This is part of my effort to build a simple and reusable 2D RPG engine. There is not much to show at this moment, and I'm cleaning up the old codes to make reading it easier. Note that part of the code is an upgrade to SDL 2.0 from Aaron's code, which used SDL 1.0.
# Update
OK so now this project expands to an editor AND a RPG game engine. The editor is usable now, fully functional, but very ugly. The game engine is about half-way from completion. I'm finishing the path-finding code in the holiday.
# Plan
- Finish the AI-pathfinding code
- Start writing AI-attack code (should be pretty easy as we only have touch attck right now, will expand to ranged attack)
- Build the cEffect class to full functional. Might as well get the cInventory done first
- Rewrite to GUI code as now I understand how to make C++ style callbacks.
